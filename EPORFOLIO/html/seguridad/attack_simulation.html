        <h1>ATTACK_SIMULATION_RA12</h1>
        
        <h3>1. A mini-summary of what to do in the challenge:</h3>
        <p>This practice focused on simulating brute-force attacks in a controlled environment to understand vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. First, we installed tools like <strong>OpenSSH, PyDictor, and DyMerge</strong> on Kali Linux Purple. We used PyDictor and DyMerge to generate custom dictionaries (combining letters and numbers). Then, we configured a local SSH server and created a target user. Using <strong>Hydra</strong>, we performed a brute-force attack against the SSH service using our generated dictionary. In the second part, we set up a vulnerable web application (DVWA) on an Apache server, identified the login form parameters, and attempted a similar brute-force attack on the web login.</p>

        <h3>2. Two complex concepts that you have learned:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dictionary Generation & Fusion:</strong> I learned how to create custom wordlists tailored to specific targets using PyDictor and how to merge different lists with DyMerge. This is crucial because generic dictionaries are often less effective than targeted ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Thread Management in Brute Force:</strong> I understood the importance of configuring the number of threads (<code>-t</code> flag) in Hydra. I encountered issues where using too many threads on a virtual machine with limited resources caused the attack to fail or freeze the system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3>3. How have you felt:</h3>
        <p>I felt challenged, especially during the configuration of the SSH attack. The resource limitations of the virtual machine caused serious problems with threading, which was frustrating at first. However, solving it by adjusting the parameters gave me a better understanding of how these tools interact with system resources.</p>

        <h3>4. What would you improve about your solutions:</h3>
        <p>For the web attack section, I discovered that the passwords in the database were encrypted (hashed), and I couldn't easily retrieve them in plain text or decrypt them during the exercise. I would improve this by researching hash cracking tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat to complement the attack simulation and fully compromise the credentials.</p>

        <h3>5. Technical words in English for the glossary:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> A method of trial and error used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys.</li>
                <li><strong>Threading:</strong> A feature that allows a program to perform multiple tasks or processes concurrently (used in Hydra to speed up guesses).</li>
                <li><strong>SSH (Secure Shell):</strong> A network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Data that describes other data. In the context of the web attack, we inspected the site's metadata to find form field names.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>6. What grade would you give the practice statement and why (0 to 10), and what would you improve:</h3>
        <p>I would give this practice an 8 out of 10. It provides a great hands-on experience with standard security tools. However, I would improve the instructions regarding virtual machine resource allocation to prevent the threading issues I encountered.</p>
