        <h1>COMAN2_LINUX_RA1</h1>
        
        <h3>1. A mini-summary of what to do in the challenge:</h3>
        <p>This practice focused on advanced user and file management in Linux. The first phase involved creating users and groups, assigning specific permissions, and working with special permission bits like <strong>SGID</strong> (to inherit group ownership) and <strong>Sticky Bit</strong> (to protect files in shared directories). We also configured default file permissions using <strong>Umask</strong>. The second phase focused on information retrieval and file searching using powerful command-line tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code>.</p>

        <h3>2. Two complex concepts that you have learned:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Special Permissions (SGID & Sticky Bit):</strong> I learned that standard Read/Write/Execute permissions are not enough for collaboration. <strong>SGID</strong> ensures that new files created in a directory belong to the directory's group (enabling team access), while the <strong>Sticky Bit</strong> prevents users from deleting each other's files in shared folders like <code>/tmp</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Umask Configuration:</strong> I understood how the <code>umask</code> value acts as a filter for default permissions. It subtracts permissions from the system default (666 for files, 777 for directories), allowing administrators to enforce a baseline security policy for new files automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3>3. How have you felt:</h3>
        <p>I felt very competent managing the system via the terminal. Understanding how permissions affect security and collaboration gave me a clearer view of Linux system administration. The search commands section was also very useful for navigating the file system efficiently.</p>

        <h3>4. What would you improve about your solutions:</h3>
        <p>While I executed the commands manually, I would improve the solution by creating <strong>Bash scripts</strong> to automate the user and directory creation process. This would reduce the chance of human error and make the setup reproducible. Additionally, I would explore using <strong>ACLs (Access Control Lists)</strong> for more granular permission settings beyond the standard Owner/Group/Others model.</p>

        <h3>5. Technical words in English for the glossary:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SGID (Set Group ID):</strong> A special permission bit that allows files created within a directory to inherit the group ownership of that directory.</li>
                <li><strong>Sticky Bit:</strong> A permission bit set on a directory that restricts file deletion; only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root can delete the file.</li>
                <li><strong>Grep:</strong> A command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Umask:</strong> A command that determines the settings of a mask that controls which file permissions are set for files and directories when they are created.</li>
                <li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> A character (like *) that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a string, useful in commands like <code>find</code> or <code>locate</code>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>6. What grade would you give the practice statement and why (0 to 10), and what would you improve:</h3>
        <p>I would give this practice a 9 out of 10. It covers essential system administration tasks. To make it perfect, I would add a section on troubleshooting permission errors, as that is a common real-world scenario.</p>
