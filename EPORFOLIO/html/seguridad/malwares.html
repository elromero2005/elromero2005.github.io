        <h1>MALWARES_RA123</h1>
        
        <h3>1. A mini-summary of what to do in the challenge:</h3>
        <p>This practice consisted of a deep research and analysis of various types of malicious software, specifically <strong>Viruses, Worms, Macros, and Backdoors</strong>. We examined their definitions, propagation methods (such as email attachments or network exploits), and the severe consequences they inflict on systems, ranging from data theft to physical infrastructure damage. The output included a detailed essay and a presentation covering real-world cases like the <strong>ILOVEYOU</strong> worm, the <strong>Stuxnet</strong> attack on nuclear centrifuges, and the <strong>Melissa</strong> macro virus.</p>

        <h3>2. Two complex concepts that you have learned:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steganography in Malware:</strong> Through the "Whitchetty" case, I learned how attackers use steganography to hide backdoors inside seemingly harmless files, like a Windows logo image, to evade antivirus detection while maintaining remote control over the infected system.</li>
                <li><strong>Worm Propagation vs. Virus Replication:</strong> I understood the key distinction that worms (like ILOVEYOU) can self-replicate and propagate across networks automatically without human intervention, exploiting vulnerabilities, whereas traditional viruses typically require a host file and user action (like opening an attachment) to spread.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3>3. How have you felt:</h3>
        <p>I felt intrigued and slightly alarmed discovering the scale of damage caused by historical malware. Learning about Stuxnet was particularly eye-opening regarding how cyberattacks can affect the physical world and critical infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>4. What would you improve about your solutions:</h3>
        <p>The current solution is purely theoretical/analytical. To improve it, I would add a practical component, such as analyzing a safe malware sample (e.g., EICAR test file) in a controlled <strong>Sandbox</strong> environment to observe its behavior in real-time without risking the actual system. This would bridge the gap between theory and practice.</p>

        <h3>5. Technical words in English for the glossary:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payload:</strong> The part of the malware code that performs the malicious action, such as deleting files or encrypting data.</li>
                <li><strong>Steganography:</strong> The practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.</li>
                <li><strong>Botnet:</strong> A network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge (often used for DoS attacks).</li>
                <li><strong>Backdoor:</strong> A method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, product, or embedded device.</li>
                <li><strong>Macro:</strong> A series of commands and instructions that you group together as a single command to accomplish a task automatically (often exploited in Office documents).</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>6. What grade would you give the practice statement and why (0 to 10), and what would you improve:</h3>
        <p>I would give the assignment an 8 out of 10. The research topics are essential for security, but the practice could be improved by including a safe, hands-on activity using analysis tools like VirusTotal or setting up a basic firewall rule to block a simulated worm port.</p>
