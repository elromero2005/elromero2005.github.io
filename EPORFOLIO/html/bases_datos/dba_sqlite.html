        <h1>DBA_SQLITE_RA12</h1>
        
        <h3>1. A mini-summary of what to do in the challenge:</h3>
        <p>This practice involved the complete administration of an SQLite database named "frutitas.db". The tasks were divided into three main blocks: storage analysis and performance optimization, where I analyzed query logs to identify that the "Mandarinas" table had high read traffic (227 SELECTs) and created indexes on <code>color</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>fecha_recogida</code> to improve speed. Secondly, I performed backup and restoration operations (`frutitas_bonitas_bonitas.db`). Finally, I automated the backup process using a Bash script scheduled with <strong>Systemd timers</strong> to run daily at 23:59:59.</p>

        <h3>2. Two complex concepts that you have learned:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log-Based Optimization:</strong> I learned how to analyze database logs to make data-driven decisions. Instead of guessing which indexes to create, I saw that the log showed a high frequency of SELECT queries on specific columns, justifying the creation of indexes to reduce search time.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemd Automation (Timer vs. Cron):</strong> I learned to use <code>systemd</code> units (`.service` and `.timer`) to automate tasks. Unlike a simple cron job, creating a specific service file allows for better control, logging, and dependency management for the backup script execution.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3>3. How have you felt:</h3>
        <p>I felt very professional automating the tasks. Moving from manually executing commands to setting up a "set and forget" system with Systemd made me feel like a real system administrator. Understanding the internals of SQLite, like the Journaling modes, was also very enlightening.</p>

        <h3>4. What would you improve about your solutions:</h3>
        <p>Currently, the database is protected by standard file permissions. To improve security for a production environment, I would implement <strong>SQLCipher</strong> to encrypt the database file itself. Additionally, regarding the PRAGMA settings, I would explore using <code>PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL</code> (Write-Ahead Logging) to improve concurrency, as discussed in the theoretical questions.</p>

        <h3>5. Technical words in English for the glossary:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PRAGMA:</strong> A special command in SQLite used to query or modify the internal operation of the library (e.g., page size, cache size).</li>
                <li><strong>WAL (Write-Ahead Logging):</strong> A journaling mode where changes are written to a separate log file first, allowing for faster and more concurrent reads and writes.</li>
                <li><strong>Index:</strong> A data structure (like a B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemd Timer:</strong> A unit configuration file in Linux used to schedule tasks, acting as a modern alternative to cron.</li>
                <li><strong>Daemon:</strong> A background process that handles requests for services such as print spooling and file transfers, or in this case, the systemd manager handling the timers.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>6. What grade would you give the practice statement and why (0 to 10), and what would you improve:</h3>
        <p>I would give this practice a 9 out of 10. It perfectly covers the lifecycle of a small database: creation, optimization, and maintenance. To achieve a 10, I would include a practical exercise on recovering a corrupted database or analyzing the performance difference before and after indexing with a timer.</p>
